##Landscape##

Financial industry domain Stripe is in: Payments/Billing

Major trends and innovations in Payments/Billing over the last 5–10 years:  These include Mobile wallets (e.g. Apple Pay), the ability to collect payments via devices connected to mobile phones (e.g. Square), Online payment services (e.g. PayPal) and cryptocurrencies (e.g. Bitcoin).  In general there has been a shift away from older forms of payments such as cash towards electronic payment methods.

##Results##

Business impact of Stripe:  Stripe has “reinvented online payment acceptance”.  It is a developer centric product offering and prevents fraud using machine learning. Historically an online company would need to set up a merchant account which was time-consuming, involved higher fees, complex compliance requirements and underwrote the risk of fraud.

##Recommendations##

* Services suggested that Stripe could offer: Currently Stripe is primarily focused on the merchant/business side of accepting payments.  It would potentially be lucrative for Stripe to enter the consumer side of payments.  Given that cards would be difficult to penetrate (as MasterCard and Visa are deeply entrenched and the set-up costs would be high) - a more logical place to enter would be Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL).  Competitors in this space are only newly established and barriers to entry would be less.  Also BNPL products are rapidly growing given the success of AfterPay and Klarna. 

* Benefits to Stripe of offering this service: Additional revenue by capturing the margins currently made by the BNPL providers.  Alternatively they could provide a lower cost BNPL offering to Stripe merchants or some combination of the two.

* Technologies this additional service would utilise: Looking at the tech stack of Afterpay - the key technologies used are Ruby and JavaScript (Source: https://w3techs.com/sites/info/afterpay.com).  These are already key technologies leveraged by Stripe.  Therefore there should be good synergies by leveraging existing capabilities.  Obviously consumer side portals would need to be built out to provide this service - e.g. a website so that consumers can view upcoming payments.

* Appropriateness of technologies;  Given these technologies are leveraged by a key competitor (Afterpay) in this space they would be appropriate for Stripe.
